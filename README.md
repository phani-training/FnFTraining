### Basics
- Visual Studio is the IDE for developing .NET Apps. 
- A place where U develop the Applications using a certain programming language at an industrial Scale. 
- VS is used for developing Applications on .NET Technology.
- .NET is a technology developed by MS for creating various kinds of Applications like Terminal Based, Web Based, Desktop Based(Windows platform), Database centric, Service Based, Micro controller level Based Applications and many more. 
- It is platform independent and Language Independent. 
- U can create .NET Apps in any platform(Win, Linux or Mac) and run on any of the other platforms.
- Language Independence means that U create a code in one acceptable Programming language and its compiled unit can be consumed in other programming language of .NET.
- Programming Languages accepted by the .NET Technology are called as CLS Compliant Languages or simply .NET languages.
- How language independency is achieved:
	- The code of the .NET Language will be compiled by its language compiler. The code will be converted into an ASSEMBLY. The extension of the ASSEMBLY files are either EXE or DLL.
	- Each assembly interally has 2 parts: MSIL(MS Intermediatory language) that has language independent code and Metadata(Info about UR Code like additional dependencies of UR code).
	- When the Application is to be executed, it can be executed only in the .NET Execution Environment called as CLR(Common Language Runtime). CLR is the part of every shippment of Windows OS since Windows 7.
	- In the CLR, lies the JIT Compiler which compiles the MSIL code to the native optimized code that will execute on the target platform. Eventually UR code becomes platform independent as well as Language Independent.
- What is C# in this picture?
	- C# is the programming language with many of its features coming from C++ and few from Java and VB. Ofcourse, it has added many new features that are not available in other languages(Atleast during its inception).
	- C# is a language built on .NET and exclusively for .NET. It is powerfull and faster to execute in the .NET System. This makes it the most popular language for developing .NET Apps. 
-What are the other programming languages supported in .NET?
	- C++, VB, Python, Cobol, Pascal, Perl, Ruby on Rails and many more languages are supported by .NET. 
	- All these languages define their compilers based on CLS(Common Language Specification). If a code is mentioned as CLS compliant, then the code is usable on any other .NET Language. CLS define the guidelines for any new programming language that wants to enter the .NET Programming language Family.
